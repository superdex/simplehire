== SIMPLEHIRE

Here's the thing: you have to hire a bunch of folks. Being the avant-garde, MacBook Air|Pro-wielding, Excel-ain't-good-enough types you are, you want a little app that you can use to track your candidates and where they are in the pipeline.

Or, you're a quite savvy recruiter who doesn't have access or time to build something yourself. (and honestly, if something like a little Rails app is something you'd build, **we need to talk**)

So yeah, this is a little Rails (4.0) app that you can use to create candidates and their contact info, upload their resumes, and track the last time they were contacted as well as where they are in your pipeline.

==== TODO
* Some front-end table UI-niceness (like js datatables er something)
* add devise and can-can so you can let some other folks have fun too and to protect those resumes
* requisite refactoring (mostly for me and increasing rails-fu)
